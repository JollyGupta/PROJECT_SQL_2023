BULK INSERT SeniorCitizen
FROM 'E:\SeniorCitizen0.csv'
WITH (
  FORMAT = 'CSV',
  FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
  FIRSTROW = 2 -- If the first row contains column headers, use 2. Otherwise, use 1 or remove this line.
);


The error message you encountered suggests that the file "E:\SeniorCitizen11.csv" is being used by another process, and SQL Server is unable to access it for the BULK INSERT operation. This error commonly occurs when the file is open in another application or is locked by another process.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that the CSV file is not currently open in any other application, such as Excel or a text editor. Close any programs that may be accessing the file.

2. Verify that the file is not being used by any other processes or services on your system. You can use tools like Process Explorer or Task Manager to check for any open file handles or processes that might be using the file.

3. Restart the SQL Server service. This can release any locks or handles on the file that might be preventing SQL Server from accessing it.

4. Move the CSV file to a different location, preferably to a folder where it is not being actively accessed by other processes. Then, update the file path in the BULK INSERT statement to reflect the new location.

After performing these steps, try executing the BULK INSERT command again in SQL Server Management Studio.

If the issue persists, there might be other underlying causes specific to your environment. In such cases, reviewing the system and application logs or consulting with your system administrator or IT support team can provide further insight into the issue.
